				<div id="bp_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last March, our club sent one team and one judge to Budapest for the Budapest Open 2013. This was the second edition of this tournament and we had the occasion to debate against many ESL teams, from eastern Europe or from Asia. But we also debated against Americans ( notably in the first Round ... They went first and we went second ...)</p>
				<p> The motions for this Tournament were: 
				<ul>
					<li> First round : THW Create Separate State Schools For Those Who Are LGBTQI </li>
					<li> Second Round : THBT Former Colonial Powers Should Never Militarily Intervene In Their Former Colonies </li>
					<li> Thrid Round : THBT, in order to continue to eat meat, individuals should be required to slaughter a major meat animal. </li>
					<li> Fourth Round : THW abolish all term limitations for elected officials in high offices. </li>
					<li> Finals : THBT the EU should censor racist websites. </li></p>

				<div id="bp_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last January we sent one team and two judges to the Trinity IV 2013. This tournament took place at the Trinity College of Dublin and was organised by the Hist and the Phil which are the debating clubs of this University ( They have two of them ! ). Many Irish adn Britishh teams were present, but we also had the occasion to meet other French teams ( from Assas, Science Po and Paris Descartes ).</p>
				<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;We enjoyed fierce debates on the following motions:</p>
				<p><ul>
					<li> First Round : THW not prosecute victims of domestic violence for crimes committed as a result of their abuse.</li>
					<li> Second Round : THBT the marketing strategies of Western NGOs have hindered the development of the global South. </li>
					<li> Third Round : THW ban the teaching of Romeo and Juliet in schools.</li>
					<li> Fourth Round : THB the campaign for marriage equality is a waste of the gay community's resources.</li>
					<li> Fifth Round : THW hold Islam accountable for the actions of Islamists.</li>
					<li> Quarter : THBT allowing women on front lines is a victory for feminism.</li>
					<li> Semi-Finals/ ESL Finals : TH as an Israeli Arab would boycott Israeli elections.</li>
					<li> Finals :THW restrict media coverage of school shootings.</li></ul></p>

				<div id="bp_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As you might have heard about it, two teams and one judge from Telecom Paristech went to the Oxford IV last weekend (9th-11th of November of 2012). The Oxford IV is the largest and most prestigious debating competition on the UK University circuit. It is hosted by the famous Oxford Union. During this debating tournament, we rubbed shoulders with students from Princeton, Yale, Stanford, Cornell, Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, UCL, SOAS…And our teams ranked 1rst and 3rd in the last round. We also advertised the Paris Open (held at Télécom Paristech in April of 2013 ) and we recruited Talheel Lateef, a debating officer of the Cambridge Union Society, to give a an expert World Style debating workshop at Telecom Paristech.</p>
				<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;And last but not least, we enjoyed nice feisty and brilliant debates and of course, we tried to make the most of our cultural immersion in the oldest academic city</p>
