				<h3>The Oxford IV 2013</h3>
				<h4><em>13/11/2012</em></h4>
				<img src="pictures/oxford.jpg", style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%" />
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As you might have heard about it, two teams and one judge from Telecom Paristech went to the Oxford IV last weekend (9th-11th of November of 2013). The Oxford IV is the largest and most prestigious debating competition on the UK University circuit. It is hosted by the famous Oxford Union. During this debating tournament, we rubbed shoulders with students from Princeton, Yale, Stanford, Cornell, Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, UCL, SOAS…And our teams ranked 1rst and 3rd in the last round. We also advertised the Paris Open (held at Télécom Paristech in April of 2013 ) and we recruited Talheel Lateef, a debating officer of the Cambridge Union Society, to give a an expert World Style debating workshop at Telecom Paristech. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And last but not least, we enjoyed nice feisty and brilliant debates and of course, we tried to make the most of our cultural immersion in the oldest academic city. </p>

				<h2>What is debating ?</h2>
				<br></br>
			
				<p>In the Telecom Debating society, we mainly debate in British Parliamentary style, but our school also takes part in the French Debating Association Tournament which is another style of debating, also known as Paris Five style.</p>

				<td id="bp_text"><p>This style ok debating a.k.a. World style debating consists of one motion four teams of two ( two teams in the proposition, two teams in the oppostion) and a motion. Each team has 15 mionutes to prepare 7 minutes to speak. This style of debating focuses a lot on the arguments and the structure of the speech.</p>
				<p> BP debating is also called World Style Debating because it is known and played all over the world and gives way to many tournaments all over the world !</p>

				<td id="fda_text">
				<p>This style of debating was invented by Declan Mc Cavana in 1994 and consists of two teams of five and a motion. Each team has one week to prepare and five minutes to speak. To win such a debate, you'll need to have your audience laugh, shout 'Hear Hear' or 'Shame'.</p>
				<p>This style is mostly played between Parisian 'Grandes Écoles' and Universities. Télécom ParisTech sends one team every year and even won the FDA tournament in 2011 ! <br><a href="http://www.frenchdebatingassociation.fr/home">If you want more informations about the FDA ...</a></br></p></td>
